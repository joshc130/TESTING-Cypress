Dynamic question fetching from a dedicated API.
Real-time score updates and quiz progression.
Comprehensive testing setup covering both component-level and end-to-end scenarios.
##Project Structure
src/components: Contains the main quiz component and other reusable UI components.
services: Hosts functions and utilities to interact with the API.
cypress: Contains all testing-related files, including component and end-to-end tests.
fixtures: Provides static data used during tests to simulate API responses.
##Setup
Install the necessary dependencies using your preferred package manager.
Start the development server to run the application.
Execute tests using Cypress, which has been configured for both component and end-to-end testing.
Testing

Component Tests: Verify individual React components in isolation.
End-to-End Tests: Simulate full user interactions, verifying that the overall application functions as expected.
Configuration
The project is set up to use modern JavaScript modules and is configured for seamless testing with Cypress. It leverages a bundler for component testing and has custom commands to streamline the testing process.

#Troubleshooting
Confirm that the development server is running on the correct port.
Verify that API responses match the expected format.
Check the project configuration for any issues related to module imports or file paths.
Consult Cypress documentation if test failures or configuration errors occur.
